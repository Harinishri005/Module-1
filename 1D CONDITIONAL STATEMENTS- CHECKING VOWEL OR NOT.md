## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Write a Python Program to take two numbers as input from the user and then calculating the following with nested if statement.1. check whether the number are equal or not.2.  find the largest of two numbers

## AIM  
```
To take two numbers as input from the user and:
1.Check whether the numbers are equal.
2.Find the largest number using nested if statements.
```


## ALGORITHM  
```
1.Start the program.
2.Take two numbers a and b as input from the user.
3.Use an if statement to check if a is equal to b.
4.If a equals b, print "A is equal to B."
5.If a does not equal b, use a nested if to check which number is larger:
6.If a > b, print "A is larger than B."
7.Else, print "B is larger than A."
8.End the program.
```

## PROGRAM
# Reg.No-212223090008
# Name-Harinishri S
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
if(a!=b):
    print("A is not equal to B")
    if(a>b):
        print("A is larger than B")
    else:
        print("B is larger than A")
else:
    print("A is equal to B")

```

## RESULT
The program correctly checks whether the numbers are equal and identifies the largest number using nested if statements.
