# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators -Perform bitwise and or on the given integer values.


## AIM
To write a Python program that performs bitwise AND and bitwise OR operations on two given integer values.

## ALGORITHM
```
1.Start the program.
2.Read two integer numbers from the user and store them in variables a and b.
3.Perform bitwise AND operation (a & b) and store the result.
4.Perform bitwise OR operation (a | b) and store the result.
5.Display the results of both operations.
```
